# DATS 6202 Final Project : Group 4

## data.csv
The dataset can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kobe-bryant-shot-selection/data).

The two python files need to be executed independently, they are not part of each other's code.
## kobe_shot_analysis.py
This script reads in our datset, contains our exploratory data analysis (including creating plots), preprocessing, and experimental modeling. We took our EDA plots, plus model metric outputs in table form, and put them into our presentation.

## opponent_analysis.py
This script read in our dataset, does analysis of Kobe Bryant's analysis against each opponent, pulls out summary statistics, and creates plots. We used these plots in our presentation. This analysis is not part of EDA leading to modelling. This is a seperate anaysis to analyze Brayant's play from opponent team's point of view in 2 of the championship years.
